			girls who code is a non-profit organization that focuses on empowering young girls and closing the gender
			gap	in the tech field. in the summer immersion program (sip), for seven weeks, a group of 20 girls goes to
			a company that hosts the program and learns about coding, courage, and sisterhood. my sip took place at
			moody's analytics in san francisco. each week, we either learned about a new topic or a new language. we
			made around one project a day and went through a total of three programming languages, learning about
			scratch, python, arduino, web development, then data analysis. we were also
			able to attend field trips to places like twitch, google, paypal, and autodesk. in addition, we were the
			one sip group chosen to present to the gwc board.

			for our final projects, we were required to work in groups of 3-4 to create a website, app or game that
			would benefit the community. for our game, we wanted to tackle the issue about how society places
			stereotypes on people based on their biological sex. We did this by created an infinite
			2d game that went through three stages of life: baby, teen, and adult to really emphasize the absurdity
			of these expectations. We chose to name the game, "LIvES", because it aims to reflect a lot of the trends
			and patterns that are seen in real life.
			<br>&lt;<span class = "pink">br</span>&gt;<br>
			when the player starts the game, they are randomly given a character (male or female, skin color, and
			hair color), reflecting how in real life, people can't choose their biological sex, skin color, or hair
			color. to gain points, the player must collect things that society deems as acceptable, just as people
			must follow society's rules to succeed in life. when the player reaches a certain number of points, they
			are allowed to continue in the next stage of life. if they collect the wrong item 3 times, they lose 1
			life, and when they lose 3 lives, the game ends, just as people are set back when they don't follow what
			society says. in addition, we changed the scoring system so that the boys are allowed to collect more
			things, reflecting how in real life, boys are given an advantage simply because of their sex. once the
			player finishes the adult stage, they complete one generation and are sent back to the baby stage. we
			chose to make this game infinite because it reflects how this cycle will keep repeating if there are no
			changes. in addition, to make the game harder, everytime the player completes a generation, the game
			speeds up.
