			the girls in tech club (git) was made to tackle the gender gap in stem fields. wanting to benefit the
			community, we offered regular tech and programming workshops to people in our school community. as a
			club, we participated in the annual technovation challenge, developing our programming skills as well as
			out marketing skills.
			<br>&lt;<span class = "pink">br</span>&gt;<br>
			i first started off being a club member of git. during my time as a club member, we competed in the 2018
			technovation challenge, spending 4 months creating a business plan and developing a safety app that would
			alert contacts and authorities during an emergency and designing the app logo using fireAlpaca and krita.
			as a co-president of git, I facilitated weekly meetings, organized future meetings and events, and
			designed coding workshops, leading a club of 10 high school girls.

			each year, technovation holds a competition and invites teams of young people from all over the world to
			learn and apply the skills needed to solve real-world problems through technology, ranging from
			implementing hardware to designing a mobile app. Our team of 3, tech4, designed an android safety app,
			called sagenet, made to tackle the common experience that many women face - feeling unsafe or threatened
			while commuting. our main goal was to empower people in our community and give them a peace of mind when
			they feel they may enter a threatening situation. while creating our app, we were able to give a pitch to
			a team at salesforce.
