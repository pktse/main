					regents'​ and chancellor's scholars association (rcsa) is dedicated to helping regents’ and

					scholarship recipients of uc berkeley develop and grow, hosting numerous events, like faculty game

					at
					uc berkeley.
					<br>&lt;<span class="pink">br</span>&gt;<br>
					During my time in rcsa, I was a part of the media and marketing committee (m&m) and the
					web-development
					committee. m&m is responsible for facilitating most avenues of communication between other
					committees
					and members of the association. we were able to apply our marketable skills, including knowledge of
					adobe software (illustrator, indesign, lightroom) and dslr photography, to regularly create
					promotional
					material for rcsa. the web-development committee was in charge of maintaing and innovating the rcsa
					website.
					<br>&lt;<span class="pink">br</span>&gt;<br>
					I was also a part of the Web Development Committee (webdev). The committee supports and updates the association’s official website . 
					Using numerous tools like HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python, the committee fixes both front and back-end issues and
					 collaborates with other committees so that the website is up-to-date with the latest information and events. In addition 
					 to using these tools, we were able to apply marketable skills like using GIT, practicing code reviews, etc.
