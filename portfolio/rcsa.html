              regents'​ and chancellor's scholars association (rcsa) is dedicated to helping regents’ and chancellor’s
              scholarship recipients of uc berkeley develop and grow, hosting numerous events, like faculty game
              night and alumni dinners, and providing resources, ranging from mentorship programs to resume
              assistance. The regents’ and chancellor’s scholars title is awarded to the top 2% of undergraduates at
              uc berkeley.
            <br>&lt;<span class = "pink">br</span>&gt;<br>  
            During my time in rcsa, I was a part of the media and marketing committee (m&m) and the web-development
              committee. m&m is responsible for facilitating most avenues of communication between other committees
              and members of the association. we were able to apply our marketable skills, including knowledge of
              adobe software (illustrator, indesign, lightroom) and dslr photography, to regularly create promotional
              material for rcsa. the web-development committee was in charge of maintaing and innovating the rcsa website.
